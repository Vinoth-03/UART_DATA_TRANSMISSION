# UART_DATA_TRANSMISSION
This project involves transferring a data set from a PC to an MCU via UART and storing it in EEPROM memory. The MCU retrieves the data from EEPROM and sends it back to the PC, while the PC code displays the real-time data transmission speed in bits per second during the transfer. The project is documented on GitHub with a detailed README file.
